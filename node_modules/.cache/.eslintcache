We are here to assist you!</div>\n        <div className=\"FAQ\">\n          <p className=\"question\">\n          Is aura reading similar to tarot reading?\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"answer\">\n            No, it’s not. Aura reading and tarot reading are two distinct practices with different methodologies and focuses. Aura reading involves perceiving and interpreting the energy fields, or auras, surrounding individuals or objects. It aims to gain insight into someone’s emotional, physical, and spiritual well-being.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"answer\">\n          On the other hand, tarot reading utilizes a deck of cards with symbolic imagery to provide guidance, insights, and predictions about various aspects of a person’s life, including relationships, career, and personal growth.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"FAQ\">\n          <p className=\"question\">\n          Is kundali reading and aura reading the same?\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"answer\">\n          No, it’s not. Kundali reading is the analysis of an individual’s birth chart, which is a graphical representation of the positions of celestial bodies at the time of their birth. Kundali reading is used to gain insights into various aspects of a person’s life, including personality traits, relationships, career, and future events. Aura reading, on the other hand, involves perceiving and interpreting the energy fields, or auras, surrounding individuals or objects. Aura reading is focused on gaining insights into a person’s emotional, physical, and spiritual well-being.\n          </p>\n          \n        </div>\n        <div className=\"FAQ\">\n          <p className=\"question\">\n          How do I determine which prediction method is best for me?\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"answer\">\n          All prediction methods share a common goal - guiding you towards the right path. The method used often depends on what the astrologer is most comfortable with. Your choice should be based on the connection you feel with the reader and the method itself. Feel free to explore various modes, as all astrological approaches are capable of providing the answers you seek.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"FAQ\">\n          <p className=\"question\">\n          What is crystal healing?\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"answer\">\n          In simple terms, I use crystal wands to remove negative energy in your aura.
